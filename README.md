Welcome to goslink. This is a simple app to link upto 3 different realms gossip. If you have any problems email me at BearFather@gmail.com and put in the subject "goslink" so I see it faster.

Setup: 1.Create an account on each board you want to link. Or if the same board 2 different accounts. 2.Disable ansi on both accounts permently(in account settings) 3.Enter the realm place the charaters in a safe place(sys supp) optional: To make to more seamless, I make the accounts invis, and hid them from toptop lists. Also not required but I like to do is "setstatline none" keeps what the app sees cleaner and less noisy. 4.Extract goslink.rar file. 5.Copy config.properties-default to config.properties 6.Edit config.properties with your info you for both servers. 7.Launch goslink.jar 8.Sit back and enjoy.

INFO: If you want to run this under a non GUI OS use noguigoslink.jar. You can also run this in a GUI OS but you wont ever see a window, and will have to kill the process to exit the program.

Remember if you want, I do accept paypal donations at my bearfather@gmail.com.
